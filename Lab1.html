  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="h6 text-center">
    My name is Maston Leit. I live in Lone Tree, CO with my wife. 
    I am originally from Honolulu, Hawaii but left when I was 8 and grew up on the east coast in Jacksonville, NC. 
    I ended up there due to my Father in Law being in the Marine Corp. 
    I grew up in a military family and had a lot of relatives and close friends joining a variety of the military branches. 
    I decided once I graduated from high school that I was going to join as well and so I ended up in the US Army as an engineer in a flight company and got to do some cool things and travel Europe. 
    I decided it was time to end my journey in the military and had always wanted to go back to school and get a degree. 
    So, in August 2018 i got out of the service and quickly enrolled into school. 
    I ended up finding the Cybersecurity Program here in 2019 and have worked to get my foot into the Defense Aerospace company Lockheed Martin. 
    I worked there for about a year as a Systems Engineer testing their older defense missile satellite program known as SBIRS(space-based infrared system). 
    Recently I was able to get my Security+ and moved on to a contracting company as a Cybersecurity Engineer working under the SBIRS Program again at Buckley Space Force(I work in the restricted area where those big golf balls are). 
    I have enjoyed my time in the military and continue to do it in school and my current job. 
    </p>
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p class="h6 text-center">
    I have two short term goals related to my field. The first goal is to grow my skillset in this industry from my current positon.
    There are tools and policies that are under my job scope so I am eager to learn as much as i can. The second goal is to get my CISSP
    before May of 2023. My company encourages us to get it and i am motivated enough to go for it. 
    My long term goal is to buy a house east of Dallas, TX and grow my family and to be closer to our family. My wife is Pregnant with our first child! 
    So we decided that the best course of action is to move and be closer to our support system.
    </p>
